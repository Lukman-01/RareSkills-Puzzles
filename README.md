# Puzzle Solutions Repository

Welcome to the RareSkills Puzzle Solutions Repository! This repository contains solutions to various coding puzzles designed to help you deepen your understanding of different technologies and concepts in a fun and challenging way.

## Why Puzzles?

Project-based learning is a powerful approach, but puzzles offer unique advantages that can enhance your learning experience:

- **Exploring New Concepts**: Projects often limit you to what you already know, but puzzles push you to engage with unfamiliar topics, helping you expand your knowledge base.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Puzzles provide direct feedback, allowing you to quickly assess whether you've understood a topic correctly.
- **Time Management**: Puzzles are bite-sized and easier to fit into a busy schedule. You can plan to solve "1 puzzle per day" and make consistent progress in your learning journey.

## About the Puzzles

All the puzzles in this repository are sourced from the **Rare Skills** platform. Rare Skills is known for offering high-quality, challenging exercises that help developers enhance their technical abilities in various domains, including blockchain, security, and zero-knowledge proofs.

## Puzzle Categories

This repository contains several folders, each dedicated to a different type of puzzle from the Rare Skills platform:

1. **Solidity Exercises**: Beginner-friendly drills to help you master the basics of Solidity, the programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

2. **Solidity Riddles**: These are 18 security-oriented Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises designed to test your understanding of Solidity and smart contract security. Perfect for those looking to enhance their security skills.

3. **Huff Puzzles**: Learn the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by building simple programs using Huff assembly language. These puzzles are a great way to get hands-on experience with low-level EVM programming.

4. **Gas Optimization Puzzles**: These puzzles challenge you to write Solidity code that meets a specific gas efficiency threshold. Perfect for developers looking to optimize their smart contracts for better performance.

5. **Uniswap V2 Puzzles**: These puzzles focus on teaching you the features and intricacies of Uniswap V2, one of the most popular decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain.

6. **Zero Knowledge (ZK) Puzzles**: Learn ZK circuit programming in Circom incrementally through these puzzles. Zero-knowledge proofs are a key component of modern cryptography and privacy-preserving technologies.
